> Like npm for local AI agent skills: one install, many coding agents.

`aweskill` is a local skill package manager for AI agents such as Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Windsurf, OpenCode, and more.

It helps developers find, install, update, bundle, deduplicate, back up, and reuse skills across multiple AI coding tools.

Instead of copying the same `SKILL.md` folders into every tool by hand, `aweskill` keeps one central source of truth in `~/.aweskill/skills/` and projects selected skills into each agent's expected directory using `symlink`, junction, or managed `copy`.

### Add the aweskill badge to your project

If your project uses aweskill and you'd like to show support, add one of these badges to your README:

| Badge | Preview |
|-------|---------|
| `aweskill-badge.svg` | Used by aweskill itself |
| `aweskill-badge2.svg` | For companion projects |

Example using `aweskill-badge2.svg`:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweskill">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Webioinfo01/aweskill/main/logo/aweskill-badge2.svg" alt="aweskill companion">
</a>
```

Place it in your README title, e.g.:

```markdown
# My Project <a href="https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweskill"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Webioinfo01/aweskill/main/logo/aweskill-badge2.svg" alt="aweskill companion"></a>
```

## Install

You can install `aweskill` yourself, or ask an AI coding agent to do it for you.

### Ask an AI agent to install aweskill

If you are working inside Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or another coding agent, tell it:

```text
Read https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweskill/blob/main/README.ai.md and follow it to install aweskill for this agent.
```

The agent will install the CLI, initialize the store, and project the built-in skills. Invoke skills (`/` in Claude Code, `$` in Codex) to check if the new skills appear — if they do, you can start using aweskill from natural-language requests right away; if not, restart the agent first.

## FAQ

### Why aweskill, and who is it for?

`aweskill` is for developers and teams who use more than one AI agent, maintain reusable `SKILL.md` folders or agent instructions, and want one local source of truth instead of copying the same skills into every tool. It is especially useful when the problem is not only distribution, but also ongoing repair: broken projections, duplicate skills, suspicious entries, stale links, and malformed `SKILL.md` files that accumulate over time.

- **One central store** for all your local skills in `~/.aweskill/skills/`
- **Search, install, and update loop** across [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/), [sciskillhub.org](https://sciskillhub.org/), GitHub-style sources, and local paths
- **Multi-agent projection** across Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Windsurf, OpenCode, and more
- **Doctor workflows for real local mess** such as broken projections, duplicate entries, suspicious files, malformed frontmatter, and drift between agent directories and the central store
- **Bundle-based organization** for reusable skill sets by project, team, workflow, or agent
- **Managed enable/disable model** with plug-and-play projection instead of manually copying folders into each tool
- **Agent-callable management and repair skills** so AI agents can run both `aweskill` and `aweskill-doctor` workflows from natural-language requests
- **Backup, restore, deduplication, cleanup, sync repair, and recovery** in one local CLI workflow
- **Local web dashboard** via `aweskill serve` for browsing skills, bundles, agent projections, and store health in the browser

<summary>More FAQ</summary>

### Where does aweskill store skills?

`aweskill` stores managed skills in `~/.aweskill/skills/`.

### Can aweskill share skills between Claude Code and Codex?

Yes. `aweskill` keeps one central copy of a skill and projects it into each agent's expected skill directory.

### Does aweskill support Cursor and Gemini CLI?

Yes. `aweskill` supports skill projection for Cursor, Gemini CLI, and many other AI agents.

### Is aweskill local-first?

Yes. `aweskill` manages skills on your local machine and does not require a hosted service.

### Can AI agents call aweskill directly?

Yes. `aweskill` ships built-in management skills for `aweskill` and `aweskill-doctor`; after installing or projecting those skills, an AI agent can follow natural-language requests to search, install, update, bundle, repair, deduplicate, clean, sync, or project skills by running aweskill commands.

### What makes aweskill different once the local skill state gets messy?

`aweskill` does not stop at install-and-project. It also gives you a repair path when local state drifts:

- **`doctor sync`** inspects or repairs broken, duplicate, matched, new, and suspicious agent entries
- **`doctor clean`** finds suspicious non-store files in managed areas before they silently accumulate
- **`doctor dedup`** helps reconcile duplicate skills without forcing blind deletion
- **`doctor fix-skills`** repairs malformed `SKILL.md` frontmatter and can back up originals first
- **`agent list` as a dry-run view** lets you inspect repair state before applying changes

### How does aweskill handle find, install, and update?

`aweskill` combines local orchestration with a source-aware skill lifecycle:

- **Find** skills across [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/), [sciskillhub.org](https://sciskillhub.org/), or the local central store with one command
- **Install** skills from GitHub-style sources, local paths, or `sciskill:<skill-id>` identifiers into the central store
- **Update** tracked installs from their recorded sources while protecting local central-store edits
- **Project** the same managed skills into Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and other agents

### What is the difference between `scan` and `install`?

Both commands add skills to the central store, but serve different purposes:

| | `store scan --import` | `store install` |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary use** | Batch discovery from agent directories | Single skill from GitHub, local path, or sciskill |
| **Source tracking** | No (one-time import) | Yes (automatic, enables `update`) |
| **Key flags** | `--override`, `--verbose`, `--scope`, `--agent` | `--skill`, `--all`, `--ref`, `--as` |
| **Typical command** | `aweskill store scan --import` | `aweskill store install owner/repo` |

Use `scan --import` for initial setup — discover and import skills from existing agent directories. Use `install` for ongoing management — install individual skills with source tracking for future updates.

`sciskill` here refers to the public registry-metadata repository under `sciskillhub`, not a local skill-manager CLI.

Use `aweskill` when your main problem is not just installing a skill once, but maintaining a reusable local skill inventory across multiple AI agents over time and keeping that local state repairable when it inevitably gets messy.

## Built-In Agent Skills

`aweskill` works best when your coding agent can operate it directly.

Project the built-in `aweskill` and `aweskill-doctor` skills into your agent first:

- `aweskill` covers day-to-day operations such as `find`, `install`, `update`, `bundle`, and `agent add`
- `aweskill-doctor` covers repair-first workflows such as `doctor sync`, `doctor clean`, `doctor dedup`, `doctor fix-skills`, and `agent recover`
- Without projecting them, an agent can still run shell commands, but it will not have the built-in skill guidance that makes aweskill workflows easier to discover and apply from natural-language requests

## Quick Start

`aweskill` is designed for a simple loop: install the CLI once, equip your agent with the built-in management skills, then let the agent operate aweskill for day-to-day work.

### 1. Bootstrap aweskill once

```bash
# Install aweskill and initialize the central store
npm install -g aweskill
aweskill store init

# Show where the aweskill store lives
aweskill store where --verbose
```

### 2. Equip your agent

```bash
# See supported agent ids
aweskill agent supported

# Project the built-in management skills into your current agent
aweskill agent add skill aweskill,aweskill-doctor --global --agent codex

# Verify the current projected state
aweskill agent list --global --agent codex
```

Replace `codex` with your agent id.

### 3. Use aweskill through natural language

After projecting `aweskill` and `aweskill-doctor`, you can ask your coding agent to do things like:

```text
Find a Python data-science skill and install the best match into aweskill.

Project my frontend bundle to Codex and Cursor.

Scan my existing agent skill directories and import anything unmanaged into the aweskill store.

Check whether any installed skills have source updates.

Inspect my Codex skills for broken or duplicate projections, but do not modify anything yet.

Repair broken and duplicate Codex projections, and back up anything risky first.
```

### 4. Common manual CLI flows

```bash
# Find a skill across supported providers
aweskill find protein

# Search the local central store only
aweskill find review --local

# Install a discovered skill into the central store
aweskill install sciskill:open-source/research/lifesciences-proteomics

# Check tracked installs for source updates
aweskill update --check

# Update aweskill itself (npm stable)
aweskill self-update

# Update aweskill from GitHub dev branch
aweskill self-update --dev

# Scan existing agent skill directories
aweskill store scan

# Scan and import discovered agent skills into the central store
aweskill store scan --import

# Create a bundle
aweskill bundle create frontend
aweskill bundle add frontend my-skill

# Enable the bundle for one agent
aweskill agent add bundle frontend --global --agent claude-code

# Inspect current projected skills
aweskill agent list

# Start the local read-only web dashboard (default http://127.0.0.1:3000)
aweskill serve
```

## Windows

`aweskill` now supports Windows as a native platform.

- Requires Node.js 20 or later
- PowerShell is recommended for the examples below
- On Windows, agent projections prefer directory junctions and fall back to managed copies when links are unavailable
- `store backup` and `store restore` no longer require a system `tar` binary

Example:

```powershell
aweskill store init
aweskill store scan
aweskill agent add bundle frontend --global --agent codex
```

If you run into Windows-specific path or projection issues, please open an issue with your shell, Node version, and target agent.

## Core Model

`aweskill` keeps one central skill store in `~/.aweskill/skills/`, groups reusable skills through bundles, and projects selected skills into each agent's own skill directory. That projected filesystem state is the activation model.

## What It Supports

Supported agents currently include:

`adal`, `amp`, `antigravity`, `augment`, `bob`, `claude-code`, `cline`, `codebuddy`, `command-code`, `continue`, `codex`, `copilot`, `cortex`, `crush`, `cursor`, `deepagents`, `droid`, `firebender`, `gemini-cli`, `github-copilot`, `goose`, `iflow-cli`, `junie`, `kilo`, `kilo-code`, `kimi-cli`, `kiro-cli`, `kode`, `mcpjam`, `mistral-vibe`, `mux`, `neovate`, `openclaw`, `openclaude-ide`, `openhands`, `opencode`, `pi`, `pochi`, `qoder`, `qwen-code`, `replit`, `roo`, `trae`, `trae-cn`, `warp`, `windsurf`, `zencoder`

Key directories:

- Central store: `~/.aweskill/skills/`
- Duplicate holding area: `~/.aweskill/dup_skills/`
- Backup root: `~/.aweskill/backup/`
- Dedup backup area: `~/.aweskill/backup/dedup/`
- fix-skills backup area: `~/.aweskill/backup/fix_skills/`
- Bundles: `~/.aweskill/bundles/*.yaml`
- Built-in skills: `resources/skills/aweskill/`, `resources/skills/aweskill-doctor/`

Discovery and install sources:

- [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) is used as a community discovery source and may return directly installable GitHub-style sources or discover-only entries that point you to the upstream skills.sh page
- [sciskillhub.org](https://sciskillhub.org/) is used as a scientific and technical skill registry and provides installable `sciskill:<skill-id>` sources
- The local central store is available as a `local` search provider and reads `~/.aweskill/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `aweskill find` searches `skills.sh` and `sciskill` by default, merges results by normalized name, and lets `--limit` apply per provider before merge and dedupe; use `--local` or `--provider local` to search only the local central store
- `aweskill store install` currently accepts local paths, GitHub sources, and `sciskill:<skill-id>` identifiers

## Common Workflows

### Scan and import skills into the central store

```bash
# Scan agent skill directories (dry-run: only discover)
aweskill store scan

# Scan and import all discovered skills
aweskill store scan --import

# Scan and import with detailed output
aweskill store scan --import --verbose

# Scan and import, overwriting existing skills
aweskill store scan --import --override

# Scan and import, keeping originals instead of replacing with symlinks
aweskill store scan --import --keep-source

# Scan specific agent only
aweskill store scan --import --agent claude
```

### Find, install, and update tracked skills

```bash
# Search both skills.sh and sciskillhub.org
aweskill find protein

# Search one provider only
aweskill find protein --provider sciskill

# Search the local central store and print matching skill paths
aweskill find review --local

# Inspect one local skill summary
aweskill store show paper-review

# Print the full markdown or just the path
aweskill store show paper-review --raw
aweskill store show paper-review --path

# Install a skill from a GitHub-style source discovered via skills.sh
aweskill store install owner/repo

# Install a scientific skill from sciskillhub.org
aweskill store install sciskill:open-source/research/lifesciences-proteomics

# Check tracked installs for updates without changing files
aweskill store update --check

# Refresh one tracked skill from its recorded source
aweskill store update lifesciences-proteomics
```

### Build reusable bundles

```bash
# Create a reusable bundle
aweskill bundle create backend

# Add multiple skills into the bundle
aweskill bundle add backend api-design,db-schema

# Inspect what the bundle contains
aweskill bundle show backend
```

### Project skills into agents

```bash
# Project one skill into detected global agent directories
aweskill agent add skill biopython

# Project multiple skills into one specific global agent directory
aweskill agent add skill biopython,scanpy --global --agent codex

# Project a whole bundle into every detected global agent directory
aweskill agent add bundle backend --global --agent all

# Turn managed symlinks back into full directories
aweskill agent recover --global --agent codex
```

### Keep the store clean

```bash
# Inspect the central store layout and entry counts
aweskill store where --verbose

# Create a backup archive of the current store
aweskill store backup

# Restore a backup archive into the current store
aweskill store restore ~/Downloads/aweskill-backup.tar.gz

# Inspect agent entries and categories
aweskill agent list

# Remove suspicious entries from the central store
aweskill doctor clean

# Move duplicate central-store skills into dup_skills
aweskill doctor dedup --apply

# Back up duplicates before moving them into dup_skills
aweskill doctor dedup --apply --backup

# Back up malformed SKILL.md files before rewriting them
aweskill doctor fix-skills --apply --backup

# Inspect repair actions for one agent
aweskill doctor sync --global --agent codex

# Repair broken / duplicate / matched agent entries for one agent
aweskill doctor sync --global --agent codex --apply

# Remove suspicious agent entries only when explicitly requested
aweskill doctor sync --global --agent codex --apply --remove-suspicious
```

All `doctor` commands default to dry-run. Add `--apply` to make real changes.

`aweskill doctor fix-skills` reports two groups of categories:

- Actionable fixes: `missing-closing-delimiter` adds the missing frontmatter closing fence, `invalid-yaml` rebuilds broken frontmatter from recoverable fields and body text, `added-frontmatter` inserts minimal frontmatter when the file starts with body content, `normalized-name` restores a usable canonical skill name, and `normalized-description` restores a usable description from the first body sentence.
- Informational checks: `normalized-required-permissions` reports permissions that could be normalized into the canonical list form, `preserved-unknown-fields` reports frontmatter fields outside the built-in core set, and `removed-empty-fields` reports blank arrays, objects, or scalar values that could be dropped.

See [docs/fix-skills-categories.md](docs/fix-skills-categories.md) for full details and before/after examples.

## Web Dashboard

`aweskill serve` starts a local read-only web dashboard (default `http://127.0.0.1:3000`). Use it to browse the central store, bundle membership, agent projection state, and hygiene issues without chaining multiple inspect commands.

```bash
aweskill store init
aweskill serve
aweskill serve --port 3456 --host 127.0.0.1
```

When running from a git checkout, build and link first so the global `aweskill` binary includes `serve` and ships the `dashboard/` assets:

```bash
npm run build
npm link          # or: npm install -g .
aweskill serve

# or run directly from source without linking
npm run dev -- serve --port 3456
```

### Pages

| Route | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `#/skills` | Central-store skills with description, source, install date; searchable |
| `#/skills/:name` | Parsed `SKILL.md` frontmatter, body preview, lock entry |
| `#/bundles` | Bundles and whether each listed skill exists in the store |
| `#/agents` | Supported agents, install status, global skills directory, projection counts |
| `#/health` | Store hygiene findings, broken symlinks, duplicates, suspicious entries; suggests `doctor sync` / `doctor clean` |
| `#/readme` | Project README with English / 简体中文 toggle |

### How it works

- **Read-only UI** — install, delete, sync, and other mutations stay in the CLI (`doctor sync --apply`, `store install`, and so on).
- **Zero frontend build** — plain HTML/CSS/JS under `dashboard/`; hash routing so the server can fall back to `index.html`.
- **Built-in HTTP server** — Node.js `http` module only; no new production dependencies.
- **Same lib logic as the CLI** — APIs reuse `listSkills`, `listBundles`, `scanStoreHygiene`, `classifyCheckedSkill`, and related helpers instead of duplicating filesystem rules.

### HTTP API

Read-only JSON endpoints under `/api`:

| Endpoint | Data |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/store` | Store root path, skill/bundle counts |
| `GET /api/skills` | Skill list with descriptions and lock metadata |
| `GET /api/skills/:name` | Single skill detail from parsed `SKILL.md` |
| `GET /api/bundles` | Bundles with per-skill existence flags |
| `GET /api/agents` | Agent registry with projection counts |
| `GET /api/health` | Hygiene summary and repair suggestions |
| `GET /api/readme?variant=en\|zh-CN` | README content for the in-app Readme page |

Runtime layout: `src/commands/serve.ts` serves APIs and static assets; `src/lib/dashboard.ts` resolves the `dashboard/` directory from both source (`src/lib`) and bundled (`dist/index.js`) layouts.

More detail: [dashboard/README.md](dashboard/README.md), [dashboard/plan.md](dashboard/plan.md).

| `aweskill bundle template import <name>` | Copy a built-in template bundle into the store |
| `aweskill agent supported` | List all supported agent ids, mark global install status with `✓` / `x`, and show detected global skills paths |

| `aweskill agent remove bundle\|skill ... [--force]` | Remove managed projections |
| `aweskill agent list [--global\|--project [dir]] [--agent <agent>] [--verbose]` | Read-only dry-run view of `doctor sync`: inspect `linked`, `broken`, `duplicate`, `matched`, `new`, and `suspicious` entries; when `--agent` is omitted, print the detected agent set for that scope before the grouped results |
| `aweskill agent recover` | Convert managed symlinks into full directories |
| `aweskill doctor sync [--apply] [--remove-suspicious] [--global\|--project [dir]] [--agent <agent>] [--verbose]` | Dry-run by default; add `--apply` to repair broken entries and relink duplicate / matched ones, and `--apply --remove-suspicious` to also remove suspicious ones; when `--agent` is omitted, print the detected agent set for that scope first |

`aweskill find` prefers to print `source` values that `aweskill store install` can use directly. When a provider returns a discover-only source such as `smithery.ai`, the result still appears, but `aweskill` marks it as unsupported for direct install and tells you to visit the matching `skills.sh` page so you can inspect the upstream installation instructions there. Local search results do not print install commands; they print the skill path and an `aweskill store show <skill>` hint instead. When searching both remote providers at once, `--limit` applies per provider before merge and dedupe.

`--domain` and `--stage` are sciskill-only filters. If you pass either flag with `--provider skills-sh`, `aweskill` now fails fast instead of ignoring the filter. When using `--domain` or `--stage` with sciskill, the value must exactly match the corresponding enum, including spaces and capitalization; invalid values also fail fast and print the allowed values.

## Built-in Skills

`aweskill` ships two meta-skills that teach AI agents how to run aweskill commands directly.

- `aweskill`: routine management for `find`, `install`, `update`, central-store workflows, bundles, and agent projection
- `aweskill-doctor`: diagnosis and repair for broken projections, duplicate skills, suspicious entries, and sync cleanup

```bash
aweskill store install resources/skills/aweskill
aweskill store install resources/skills/aweskill-doctor
```

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for skill directory structure and design principles.
